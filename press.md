      What this gorgeous cloud atlas reveals about the world below
      <br />
      <small>May 16, 2016 // by Ana Swanson, The Washington Post</small>
  	</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Two scientists, Adam Wilson and Walter Jetz, are trying to get a more accurate picture of the planet not by looking around the cloud cover but by looking at it. Working as part of a collaborative project that seeks to develop a model for monitoring biodiversity, Wilson and Jetz have compressed 15 years of satellite imagery of the world’s clouds into some gorgeous maps.

      Wildlife conservation from outer space
      <br />
      <small>April 7, 2016 // by Dana Kobilinsky, Wildlife</small>
  	</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Adam Wilson and his team used cloud data to determine ways to improve predictions of suitable habitat for the Montane Woodcreeper and King Protea. They also showed how the data could be used to map entire ecosystems such as the world’s cloud forests — tropical or subtropical forests with persistent low-level clouds.

      Using clouds to locate threatened species
      <br />
      <small>April 6, 2016 // by Laura Cole, Geographical</small>
  	</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Clouds can provide an unconventional source of ecological information. Using remotely sensed satellite data allows researchers to predict species distributions in hard-to-reach places.

      A Cloud Atlas Provides Clues to Life on Earth
      <br />
      <small>April 4, 2016 // by Joanna Klein, New York Times</small>
	</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      By creating cloud atlases, researchers were able to better predict the location of plants and animals on land with unprecedented spatial resolution, allowing them to study certain species, including those that are often in remote places.

      Cloud Cover Key to Finding Threatened Species
      <br />
      <small>March 31, 2016 // by Kieran Mulvaney, Discovery</small>
  	</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Scientists from the University at Buffalo and Yale University have shown that there is one especially effective way of calculating the whereabouts of species, including those that may be threatened or endangered: look to the clouds.
