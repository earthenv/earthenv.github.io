## GMBA Mountain Inventory


### A hierarchical inventory of the world’s mountains for global comparative mountain science

A standardized inventory of the world’s’ mountains is an essential tool for comparative mountain science and policy-making. Here we provide a new inventory of > 8000 hierarchically organised mountain ranges, which we developed based on a new definition of mountains and the application of a semi-automated method to achieve high levels of accuracy in the outlining of the digitized shapes. This hierarchical inventory allows users to define different levels of aggregation from continental to small subrange level, according to their needs and the scale of their analyses provides a key resource for mountain research across the natural and social sciences.
