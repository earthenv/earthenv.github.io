The EarthEnv project is a collaborative project of biodiversity scientists and remote sensing experts to develop near-global standardized, 1km resolution layers for monitoring and modeling biodiversity, ecosystems, and climate. The work is supported by NCEAS, NASA, NSF, and Yale University.

      A standardized delineation of the worlds’ mountains has many applications in research, education, and the science-policy interface. Here we provide a new inventory of 8616 mountain ranges developed under the auspices of the Global Mountain Biodiversity Assessment (GMBA). Building on an earlier compilation, the presented geospatial database uses a further advanced and generalized mountain definition and a semi-automated method to enable globally standardized, transparent delineations of mountain ranges worldwide. The inventory is presented on EarthEnv at various hierarchical levels, allowing users to select their preferred level of regional aggregation from continents to small subranges according to their needs and the scale of their analyses. The clearly defined, globally consistent and hierarchical nature of the presented mountain inventory offers a standardized resource for referencing and addressing mountains across basic and applied natural, social sciences research and a range of other uses in science communication and education.

    <p class="lead">
      Tropical cloud forests (TCFs) are one of the world’s most species- and endemism-rich terrestrial ecosystems. TCFs are threatened by direct human pressures and climate change, yet the fate of these extraordinary ecosystems remains insufficiently quantified. With discussions of the post-2020 biodiversity framework underway, TCFs are a defining test case of the success and promise of recent policy targets and their associated mechanisms to avert the global biodiversity crisis. Here we present a global assessment of the recent status and trends of TCFs and their biodiversity and evaluate the efficacy of current protection measures. We find that cloud forests occupied 0.4% of the global land surface in 2001 and harboured ~3,700 species of birds, mammal, amphibians and tree ferns (~15% of the global diversity of those groups), with half of those species entirely restricted to cloud forests. Worldwide, ~2.4% of cloud forests (in some regions, more than 8%) were lost between 2001 and 2018, especially in readily accessible places. While protected areas have slowed this decline, a large proportion of loss in TCF cover is still occurring despite formal protection. Increased conservation efforts are needed to avert the impending regional or global demise of TCFs and their unique biodiversity.

    <p class="lead">
      High-resolution climatic data are essential to many questions and applications in
      environmental research and ecology. Here we develop and implement a new semi-mechanistic
      downscaling approach for daily precipitation estimate that incorporates high resolution
      (30 arc sec) satellite-derived cloud frequency. The downscaling algorithm incorporates
      orographic predictors such as wind fields, valley exposition, and boundary layer height,
      with a subsequent bias correction. We apply the method to the ERA5 precipitation archive
      and MODIS monthly cloud cover frequency to develop a daily gridded precipitation time series
      in 1km resolution for the years 2003 onward. Comparison of the predictions with existing
      gridded products and station data from the Global Historical Climate Network indicates an
      improvement in the spatio-temporal performance of the downscaled data in predicting
      precipitation. Regional scrutiny of the cloud cover correction from a topographically
      highly heterogeneous area further confirms that CHELSA-EarthEnv performs well in
      comparison to other precipitation products such as numerical weather models. The
      presented CHELSA-EarthEnv daily precipitation product improves the temporal accuracy
      compared to ERA5 but with an additional improved spatial accuracy and much better
      representation of precipitation in complex terrain.
